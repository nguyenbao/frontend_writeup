### How the web works

The web relies on Brower (Firefox, Chrome, etc...) which we call clients and Web Application which returns something call HTML. 

When you put a link on the Browser, for example, ```https://google.com```, the Browser will talk with the Web Application on Google and that Web Application will return a HTML. The Browser reads the HTML and displays things for you. 

HTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. HTML is composed by component call **Tag**.
